Sexual assault is the term that we are encountering more and more these days, as the controversy about the subject heats up, the phrase tends to be tossed everywhere like a punchline in a women's rights debate. But the reality is that sexual assault and sexual violence are not just something to debate and using it as a political agenda, it is a major problem influencing all women and impacting every aspect of their lives.

The statistics we've seen recently about sexual violence are shocking. In the United States alone, there are about 433,648 cases of rape and sexual assault occur annually.

Sexual assault can impact survivors on a long-term basis. Studies show that women who have experienced sexual assault seem to be more likely to have serious health issues including PTSD, anxiety, and depression.

In addition, sexual violence causes a greater risk of STIs including chlamydia, herpes, and HIV. This indicates that rape victims may be vulnerable for a longer period of time to such types of diseases and infections than women who have not experienced sexual abuse.
